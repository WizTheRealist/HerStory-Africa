# Contributing to HerStory Africa

Thank you for wanting to help tell the stories of African women who shaped history. This project is built on research, accuracy, and respect — and contributions that share those values are always welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add a woman's profile

This is the most impactful contribution. If you know an African woman whose story deserves to be here:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new file: `app/content/women/[slug].md` (use lowercase, hyphenated slug)
3. Follow the profile schema below
4. Add a profile image to `public/women/[slug].jpg` or `.png`
5. Submit a pull request with your sources listed

### 2. Add an article

Articles provide context, analysis, or explainers for a general audience. Same process — add a Markdown file to `app/content/articles/` and open a PR.

### 3. Fix an error

If you spot a factual error, a broken link, or a typo, open an issue or submit a PR directly.

### 4. Improve the code

Bug fixes, performance improvements, and accessibility enhancements are welcome. For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Profile Schema

Every woman's profile must include this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: "Full Name"
slug: "full-name"
country: "Country"
region: "West Africa"        # West Africa | East Africa | Southern Africa | Central Africa | North Africa
born: 1900                   # Year as number, or null if unknown
died: 1978                   # Year as number, or null if still alive
era: "Colonial"              # Pre-Colonial | Colonial | Independence | Modern | Contemporary
causes:
  - "Political rights"
  - "Women's education"
image: "/women/full-name.png"
imageCredit: "Source / License"
featured: false
summary: "One or two sentences summarising who she was and what she did."
---
```

The body should include these sections in order:

- `## Biography`
- `## Historical Context`
- `## What She Fought For`
- `## Major Achievements`
- `## Her Impact Today`

End with a sources line: `*Sources: Wikipedia (Name), Encyclopædia Britannica, etc.*`

See any existing profile in `app/content/women/` for reference.

## Article Schema

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "A one-sentence summary."
date: 2026-03-15
slug: article-slug
category: "History"          # History | Concepts | Why It Matters
image: "/articles/article-slug.jpg"      # optional
imageCredit: "Source / License"           # optional
---
```

## Sourcing Requirements

- Every profile must cite verifiable sources: Wikipedia, Encyclopædia Britannica, national archives, academic publications, or primary historical documents.
- Do not submit profiles based solely on social media posts, blog articles, or unverified claims.
- Image sources must be public domain, Creative Commons, or explicitly licensed for use. Note the license in `imageCredit`.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IwuchukwuDivine/herstory-africa.git
cd herstory-africa
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Style

- Vue components use `<script setup lang="ts">`
- BEM-style class naming with component prefix (e.g. `suggest__field`)
- CSS custom properties from the theme — never hardcode colours
- No unnecessary comments — code should be self-explanatory

Run `npm run lint` before submitting a PR.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one profile, one fix, or one feature per PR.
- Write a clear description of what changed and why.
- For new profiles, list your sources in the PR description.
- For code changes, explain the reasoning.

Open an issue or reach out. We would rather you ask than guess.
